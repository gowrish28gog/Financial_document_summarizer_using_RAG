In the init function of this class, we ingest the data from the dataset in the vector database. This class have as well a query member function. In this function we first perform similarity search with the query to the vector database. Then, we call the generate function of the ai agent object. Before returning the answer, we use a predefined template to compose the overal response from the question, answer and the context retrieved.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Packages instalation and
